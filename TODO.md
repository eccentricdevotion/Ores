# TODO

1. Make a HUD that shows the block type you are looking at e.g. mushroom blocks -> ore blocks
    - toggle on/off via command
    - option to show just ores / pipes and ignore vanilla blocks
2. Make water flow through pipes
    - Collector provides source - should be powered to start pump and trace pipe path, if connected to a hopper, should
      transport items to end of pipe
    - final pipe +1 spawn water block
3. Find use for aluminium - craft nuclear power source?
4. Uranium -> powers and ingredient in, nuclear power source
